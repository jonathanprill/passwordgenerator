# passwordgenerator

A client needs a password generator that randomly generates passwords based on the users selected criteria.
It will generate passwords between 8 and 128 characters long. It will ask the user certain character types they desire to include in the password and confirm each selection.
The unique password will be displayed either on screen or in a alert message box.
